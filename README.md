# Instagram followers comparator
Compare followers and followings 

To compare our Instagram followers and subscriptions, we can use Instagram's official data export feature and then analyze these files with a small piece of Python code.

Here's how to do it, step by step:

- Step 1: Download your Instagram data : Go to your Instagram app or website.
- Settings and privacy -> Accounts -> Your information and permissions.
- Click on Download your information.
- Request a download, select “Some of your information” and check only Followers and following .
- Important: Choose JSON format (not HTML).
- Instagram will send you a link by email (this takes a few minutes to an hour). Download the .zip file and extract it.

Then, run the Python file, paying attention to the file names.
